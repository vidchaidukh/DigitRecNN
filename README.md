# Digital Recognition Neural Network
Two-layer neural network for recognizing handwritten numbers on pure Python with a telegram bot interface
### Temporarily not working!<br><br>

### Sample of recognizing:<br>
To use the bot, you need to send it an image of the required size with a written number.<br>

### Sample of training:<br>
And if you want to help it learn, then in the description write which number wrote on it.<br>
