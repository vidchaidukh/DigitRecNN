# Digital Recognition Neural Network
Two-layer neural network for recognizing handwritten numbers on pure Python with a telegram bot interface
### Temporarily not working!<br><br>

### Sample of recognizing:<br>
To use the bot, you need to send it an image of the required size with a written number.<br>
